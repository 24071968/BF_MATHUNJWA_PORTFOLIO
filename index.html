            <p>I am a second year BSc in
                Computer Scientist student
                at the University of Venda. Where I had the opportunity to gain
                and polish my coding skills as I
                have been in an IT System Developement Learneship with the AfriGIS
                company for 2 years. During the
                course of the learnership I had a previllege to write 3 Microsoft
                Azure Certificates, Az-900, Az-204
                and Az-400. I am greatful for that opportunity it made me to see the
                world from a different perspective and I decided to join the tech world.
                I am also a founder of to small business, Byte Bakes and Nailed by Bongie.Byte Bakes is my small
                business
                that helps me to earn a few rands as a student. I am selling
                scones at a very affordable price to students and also to other community members who are
                interested and believe my business is worthy of their support. "Byte Bakes"is a fusion of
                two passions that define me: technology and baking.The work byte represent my tech- background
                the digital world I live and learn every day. But outside the code and algorithms, there's another
                side of me- a passionate baker who finds joy in creating warm, delicious scones that bring people
                together.<strong>Byte Bakes where digits meets delicious</strong> Above all I am also a certified nail
                and
                lashes technician.I am the hands and heart behind
                Nailed by Bongie, a modern nail and lash beauty studio where creativity meets care.</p>
