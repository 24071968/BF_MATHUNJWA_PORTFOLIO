# BF_MATHUNJWA_PORTFOLIO
# Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This project involves designing and developing a responsive, user-friendly personal web portfolio that showcases my academic background, skills, and interests. The portfolio follows the principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and best practices in web design. The objective is to create a polished and professional online presence using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.

This portfolio also serves as a demonstration of the skills I learned in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) module, where we apply principles of user-friendly and effective interface design.
